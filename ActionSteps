only essencial steps and ones that regard communication are listed

* = "(BUFFER_SIZE file terminated with NULL)"

TCP_RECEIVE_FILE (client):

2. get files' "saveTo" location from java module *
3. get files' size in bytes from server
4. download a file from server
5. send success response to java module *
note: path is created from default download path + saveToLocation

TCP_SEND_FILE (server):
1. send files' size in bytes
2. send file
note: files' path and name used to open sent file come from received request forms

TCP_MKDIR (client):
1. get directories relative path from java module *
2. create a new directory
3. send success response to java module *
note: new directory is created from default download path + newDirectoryPath

TCP_SEND_FILE (client):
1. get uploaded files' "upload from" location from the java module *
2. send the files' size in bytes
3. upload the file
4. send success response to java module *

TCP_RECEIVE_FILE (server):
1. get files' size in bytes
2. download the file
note: download location and file name come from received request forms

TCP_MKDIR (server):
1. create a new directory
note: directories location comes from received request forms

TCP_CONTINUE and TCP_EXIT don't communicate anywhere and so they are not listed here
