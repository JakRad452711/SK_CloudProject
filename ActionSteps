README
this file is supposed to visualize steps taken by TCP client and TCP server applications
in order to complete certain actions. Only steps that regard communication between
C client, C server and C client Java client or are supposed to help visualize how programs
work are listed.

* = "(BUFFER_SIZE size file terminated with NULL)"

shared steps:
1. wait for request form from java module *
2. pass request form to server *
3. get response from the server *
4. pass response to java module *
5. take action and execute (int value of sizeof(int)) [available action values are presented in Shared/Actions.h]

TCP_RECEIVE_FILE (client):
1. get files' name from java module *
2. get files' "saveTo" location from java module *
3. get files' size in bytes from server
4. download a file from server
note: path is created from default download path + saveToLocation

TCP_SEND_FILE (server):
1. send files' size in bytes
2. send file
note: files' path and name used to open sent file come from received request forms

TCP_MKDIR (client):
1. get directories relative path from java module *
2. create a new directory
note: new directory is created from default download path + newDirectoryPath

TCP_SEND_FILE (client):
1. get uploaded files' "upload from" location from the java module *
2. send the files' size in bytes
3. upload the file

TCP_RECEIVE_FILE (server):
1. get files' size in bytes
2. download the file
note: download location and file name come from received request forms

TCP_MKDIR (server):
1. create a new directory
note: directories location comes from received request forms

TCP_CONTINUE and TCP_EXIT don't communicate anywhere and so they are not listed here
